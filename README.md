## 📁 Project Management App

This section is another practice module where you apply both core and advanced React concepts by building a small project management app.

### 🔧 What’s covered:
- Creating and deleting projects
- Adding and clearing tasks for each project
- Switching between views and managing component state
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Optionally using:
  - Refs
  - Forwarded refs
  - Portals
  - `useImperativeHandle`

### 🧰 Starter Code:
- Provided as both local and CodeSandbox versions
- Tailwind CSS already configured
- Includes a basic app layout and components

### 💡 Goal:
Try building the app on your own using:
- Components and props
- State management
- Refs (for form inputs and modals)
- Portals (for rendering modals)
